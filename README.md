## Copying 
Copying this repo are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

## Suggestions
You can use ```repl.it``` this website for free discord.py bot hosting.

Remember to use ```.env``` to hide your token if you use ```repl.it``` and you do not have ```hacker``` plan or your repo is ```pubic```.

Even repl.it cannot search other people's repl they can still use the way ```repl.it/@username``` to find your profile. If your repl is pubic it will appear on your profile then your bot token maybe will will let them know so I highly recommanded you use ```.env``` to hide your token.

## Advaned Suggestions
You can use ```setting.json``` for a small database to put somethings like token

You can use cogs to make some catagory of most of the commands.
